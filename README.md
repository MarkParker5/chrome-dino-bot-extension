Initially, it was planned to fully automate the launch of the bot on an offline tab, but Chrome's security policy prohibits code injection on such system pages. The extension copies the required script to the clipboard when you click on a button in the extension pop-up, but you will have to run it manually through the console.

original bot: https://github.com/danpush/t-rex-game-bot
